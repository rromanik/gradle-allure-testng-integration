# Project integrating Gradle - Allure - TestNG

This project is created to try out integrating Gradle with Allure reporter and with TestNG.
I'm going to move from the simplest possible configuration to more complex as more features will be required.

As of November 22, 2021, the latest versions of tools are following:
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): 7.3
- Allure gradle plugin: 2.9.6

[Allure-gradle GitHub](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-gradle)

[Allure Gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.qameta.allure)


- TestNG: 7.4.0
[TestNG web site](https://testng.org/doc/)

[TestNG GitHub](https://github.com/cbeust/testng)

## Initial configuration
Initially `build.gradle` file looked like following
```
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

group 'nik.roma'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.testng:testng:7.4.0'
}

test {
    useTestNG()
}
```
## Experiment 1: add only Allure gradle plugin
See branches starting with `v1-`.

**Goal:** I want to generate allure report after my tests are run.

Let's add Allure gradle plugin
```
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'io.qameta.allure' version '2.9.6'
}
```
After this modification, `allureReport` task becomes available.
Running command 
```
./gradlew clean test allureReport
``` 
leads to the following
* Allure commandline is downloaded into `/build/allure/commandline` folder. 
Based on the artifacts found in this folder, we can conclude that Allure commandline version is `2.13.6`
* Allure results are collected into `/build/allure-results` folder.
* Allure report is generated into `/build/reports/allure-report` folder
* Allure report is opened without any issues in a browser.

## Experiment 2: Specify Allure report version explicitly
See branches starting with `v2-`.

**Goal:** I want to explicitly control the version of allure report. 

In Experiment 1, allure gradle plugin seems to select 
a default version of allure report, which was `2.13.6`.
At the moment, the latest version of allure report is `2.16.1`.
To use it, let's add the following to `build.gradle`
```
allure {
    version = '2.16.1'
}
```
Now, running command
```
./gradlew clean test allureReport
``` 
leads to the following:
* Allure commandline is downloaded into `/build/allure/commandline` folder.
This time the version is `2.16.1`.

Other results are the same as in Experiment 1.

## Experiment 3. Add SLF4J NOP logger
See branches starting with `v3-`.

**Goal:** I want to get rid of SLF4J errors in console.

When allure dependency is added to the project, and if `testLogging.showStandardStreams = true` added to `build.gradle`
under `test`, there are following errors in console:
```
Gradle Test Executor 5 STANDARD_ERROR
    SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
    SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
    SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
```
To avoid them, let's add `slf4j-nop` dependency explicitly:
```
testImplementation group: 'org.slf4j', name: 'slf4j-nop', version: '1.7.32'
```
After this, executing `./gradlew test allureReport` does not generate any errors in console.
